This is the tricky one. The amount of funds contributed to the company that are
not held in liabilities. Sounds like a pretty covenient definition, so here's
what it consists of:

- Contributed Capital
  - The ownders put into the company
- Shares/Stock
  - The opposite of investments
  - both common and preferred
- Retained Earnings
  - Revenue - Expenses = Net Income
  - Which is made up of money the business has made (or lost) for itself.

* Profit and loss
- Revenue - Expenses = Profit aka "Net Income"

Different types of income like "Gross Income", "Operating Income", and "Net
Income"
- "Gross Income" - Revenue - Cost of Good Sold (wood + the labor to build the
  table)
- "Gross Margin"
- "Operating Income" - Gross Income - Sells & Marketing, Administrative, ...
- "Net Income" - Operating Income - tax, ...
- "Revenue"
- "Cost of Good Sold" - Systems and support team
- "Sells and Marketing"

* Revenue vs ARR
Revenue includes any income generated from normal business activities from the
sale of goods and services to customers.

Annual Recurring Revenue is the amount that will recur in subsequent terms,
which is supported by an "auto-renew" clause in customer contracts.

* Why is ARR Important?
** The ability to plan for future growth
- Predictable flow of funds
- We would not be able to budget future revenues reliable w/o ARR
** Industry statndard
- Comparison to other companies usually based on ARR and ARR growth
