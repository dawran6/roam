* Dynamic Scope vs Lexical Scope
** Example: [[https://youtu.be/zp0OEDcAro0?t=513][Condition Systems in an Exceptional Language - Chris Houser (8:33)]]

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn parse-log-entry [text]
  ...)

(defn parse-log-file [log]
  (let [lines (with-open [stream (io/reader log)]
                (doall (line-seq stream)))]
    (keep (parse-log-entry lines))))
#+END_SRC

The body of =parse-log-entry= is in the *dynamic scope* of the =parse-log-file=
function. Whereas the =parse-log-file= function provides the symbol =lines=
within the *lexical scope* of the =let=-binding.

** Dynamic binding
- [[https://clojure.org/reference/vars][Vars and the Global Environment]]
By default Vars are static, but Vars can be marked as dynamic to allow
per-thread bindings via the macro binding.
